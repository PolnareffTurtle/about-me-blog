        <p id="aboutme">
          I am currently a junior at Otay Ranch High School. My favorite
          subjects include math and computer science. I am especially interested
          in creating games through Python using Pygame, and I have a lot of
          experience with competition math. I run cross country and track at my
          school, but I really love being a part of my school's quiz bowl team.
          Outside of school I like listening to NewJeans and playing video
          games. I am very excited to be a part of this early start program!
